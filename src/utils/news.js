    title: `Brent Sass Wins His 1st Iditarod Sled Dog Race Across Alaska`,
    article: `Musher Brent Sass won the arduous Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race across Alaska on Tuesday as his team of 11 dogs dashed off the Bering Sea ice through a crowd of fans in downtown Nome. “It's awesome, it's a dream come true,” Sass said with his beard and mustache partially encrusted in ice during the post-race interview before he was presented a prize-winning check of $50,000.
    “When I started mushing, my goal was to win the Yukon Quest and win the Iditarod. Checked them both off the list now," he said.`,
